## Image Feature Extraction, Feature Selection and SVM classification

## Feature_Extraction.py : This module extracts list of image features from jpeg files and writes to a csv file. The path to the folder of the images has to be changed in the code accordingly. 

## SVM_Classify.py : This program performs SVM classification and RFE feature selection. It also produces ROC curve for the classification. The file takes spam image features and ham image features in CSV format(output of the feature extraction module).
 
## graphs.py : This program plot all the feature value as histogram for comparison for ham and spam.

## Python Version : Python 3.5.0

## Modules Required :

   - Numpy
   - Scipy
   - Matplotlib
   - Pandas
   - Opencv
   - PIL
